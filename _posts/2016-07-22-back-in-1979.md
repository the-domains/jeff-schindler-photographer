  This photograph is of my grandfathers 67 birthday when they lived in the
  Spokane Valley ( before being incorporated in 1990, another story another day)
  off of University rd just north of Sprague ave. See those cars in the
  background, the ones I pointed to with red arrows. Those are 1962 DKW juniors,
  small 3 cylinder aluminum block motor from Germany, the autounion to be
  precise. My grandfather gathered up several DKWâ€™s when in 1970 the Energy
  Crisis began and the american fuel shortage happened. to learn more about the
  DKW junior

# Back in 1979
![way back in the year 1979](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ccccf18749bfbc2073ac50aae1d6be7519fd4d9.jpg)

### I love photography, old photos, and old vintage cars probably not in that specific order. Here is an old family photo I have recently come across from 1979, recently I have begun scanning my families scrap book, photo albums, shoe boxes, and the Ektagraphic carousels of Kodachrome slides; yes it is a huge project.

This photograph is of my grandfathers 67 birthday when they lived in the Spokane Valley ( before being incorporated in 1990, another story another day) off of University rd just north of Sprague ave. See those cars in the background, the ones I pointed to with red arrows. Those are 1962 DKW juniors, small 3 cylinder aluminum block motor from Germany, the autounion to be precise.
